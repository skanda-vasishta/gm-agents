The roster size is only 5 players, which is insufficient for a competitive season. Additionally, the team is well over the salary cap limit, making it impossible to sign impactful free agents without exceeding financial constraints. The primary focus should be on creating salary cap space and acquiring young talents or draft picks for future growth, rather than immediate success in playoffs.
