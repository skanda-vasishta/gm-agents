Trade Information:
Certainly! Here’s a structured breakdown of the trade proposal from the image:

---

### 1. Players/Assets being **traded from your team** (Charlotte Queens):

- **Keaton Wallace** ($600k)
- **Larry Nance Jr.** ($11.21M)
- **Jacob Toppin** ($600k)
- **Total outgoing salary:** **$12.41M**

---

### 2. Players/Assets being **received by your team** (Charlotte Queens):

- **Moussa Diabaté** ($2.37M)
- **Total incoming salary:** **$2.37M**

---

### 3. **Draft picks involved:**
- **No draft picks** are shown as being included in this trade proposal.

---

### 4. **Salary Implications:**

- **Charlotte Queens (Your Team):**
  - **Payroll after trade:** $180.61M
  - **Existing salary cap:** $140.6M
  - **Team OVR** (Overall Rating): Decreases from 51 to 52

  **Warning:** Charlotte Queens are over the salary cap. NBA trade rules require the received salary to be less than 125% of the traded salary, and this trade currently does not satisfy that rule.

- **Atlanta Gold Club:**
  - **Payroll after trade:** $192.51M
  - **Salary cap:** $140.6M
  - **Team OVR:** Increases from 56 to 56

---

**Summary:**  
Charlotte Queens are sending out three players (Wallace, Nance Jr., Toppin) with a combined salary of $12.41M, receiving one player (Diabaté) at $2.37M. No draft picks are included. The trade fails current salary-matching rules due to cap restrictions for the Charlotte Queens.

**Trade Proposal Breakdown:**

**1. Players/Assets traded from your team (Los Angeles Earthquakes):**
- Georges Niang (Salary: $8.35M)
- Larry Nance Jr. (Salary: $11.21M)
- Total salary outgoing: $19.56M

**2. Players/Assets received by your team:**

- Los Angeles Earthquakes receive a 2027 2nd round pick.

**4. Salary implications:**
- After the trade:
  - **Los Angeles Earthquakes' payroll:** $204.01M (down from previous amount, as $19.56M in player salaries are traded out)
  - **Atlanta Gold Club's payroll:** $182.99M (increased due to addition of $19.56M in player salaries)

**Additional Note:**
- Warning: Los Angeles Earthquakes are over the salary cap, so the incoming salaries must fit the CBA's 125% rule. This deal would need to be checked for compliance with league salary rules.

**Summary:**  
Los Angeles Earthquakes would send Georges Niang and Larry Nance Jr. to the Atlanta Gold Club in exchange for a 2027 2nd round pick, clearing $19.56M in salary from their books but must ensure the deal fits trade rules due to being over the salary cap.

- **Keaton Wallace** ($600k)
- **Larry Nance Jr.** ($11.21M)
- **Jacob Toppin** ($600k)

### 2. Players/Assets being **received by your team** (Charlotte Queens):

### 3. **Draft Picks Involved:**
- **None mentioned** in this trade proposal.

### 4. **Salary Implications:**
- After the trade:
    - **Charlotte Queens' payroll:** $180.61M (decreases due to salary dump)
    - **Charlotte Queens' salary cap:** $140.6M
    - **Charlotte Queens' team OVR:** decreases from 51 → 52 (improves by 1)

    - **Atlanta Gold Club's salary cap:** $140.6M
    - **Atlanta Gold Club's team OVR:** increases from 56 → 56 (no change)

> **Warning:** The Charlotte Queens are above the salary cap, so the salaries they receive in a trade must not exceed 125% of the salaries they trade away. In this scenario, the value is at 19%, which is compliant.

---

**Summary:**  
Charlotte is trading out Keaton Wallace, Larry Nance Jr., and Jacob Toppin (combined $12.41M), and receiving only Moussa Diabaté ($2.37M), with no draft picks involved. The trade reduces salary for the Charlotte Queens and slightly boosts their team overall.
